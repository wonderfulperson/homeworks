Title: Proposal to incentivize donors

Short description: This proposal aims at increasing donations by encouraging regular donations.

Scope/longer description: The donors donate cUSD and get $PACT as reward. To solve the problem of not having anymore enough donations at some moments, it would be useful to encourage people to donate on a regular basis. If a donor donates regularly, for example, every month, and during 6 months, in additional to the $PACT he/she should get normally, he/she can get some extra $PACT. The amount of extra $PACT can be proportional with the duration that the donation lasts for and with amount of the donation. This applies also for companies who want to donate, for NGOs, and with a frequency of 1 year for example.

Metrics or Key Performance Indicators: The number of regular donors will increase and the raisefunding will be more stable, the raisefunding compared to 30 previous days may not drop dramatically.
